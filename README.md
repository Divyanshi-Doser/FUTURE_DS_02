# 📊 Customer Support Ticket Analysis — Internship Project

This project was completed as part of my internship with **Future Intern**, focusing on analyzing over **8,400 real-world customer support tickets** to uncover bottlenecks and recommend data-driven improvements.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze customer support tickets and extract **common issues**, evaluate **response/resolution patterns**, and suggest actionable solutions to improve overall support efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- `pandas` — Data cleaning & manipulation  
- `nltk` — Text preprocessing and keyword extraction  
- `matplotlib` — Data visualization  
- `wordcloud` — Visual representation of top keywords

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Most tickets are stuck in **"Pending Customer Response"**, indicating delays on the customer’s side.
- **Technical issues** are resolved the fastest, while **product-related** queries take more time.
- Common keywords in tickets include: _“issue”, “please”, “assist”, “problem”, “product”, “account”_

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🔧 Deploy a **chatbot** to answer common technical/product queries instantly  
- 🔄 Simplify the **cancellation/refund** process to reduce ticket generation  
- 📚 Maintain an FAQ system based on **real ticket keywords**
- 📢 Notify users proactively about **known issues**
- 📈 Regular monthly analysis of tickets to track improvements
